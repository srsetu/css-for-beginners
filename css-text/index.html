  <h1>It is never too late to be what you might have been.</h1>

  <p>today I choose life. every morning when I wake up I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... to feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices - today I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity but embrace it.</p>

  <p>When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.</p>
